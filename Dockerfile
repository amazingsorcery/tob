# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Multi-stage build for the Next.js 15 App Router application.
#
#   base     -> pinned Node 22 + corepack-managed pnpm, shared by every stage
#   deps     -> node_modules only (the expensive, rarely-invalidated layer)
#   builder  -> `pnpm build` producing .next/standalone
#   migrator -> one-shot image for `pnpm db:migrate` / `pnpm db:seed` (needs devDeps: tsx)
#   runner   -> final runtime image: slim, non-root, production-only files
#
# Build targets:
#   docker build --target runner   -t app-web:current    .
#   docker build --target migrator -t app-migrate:current .
#
# THERE IS NO `worker` STAGE, and its absence is a decision (ADR 0031). This file used to
# carry a `FROM migrator AS worker` stage ending in `CMD ["pnpm", "worker"]` — a script that
# never existed in package.json, so the container it produced crash-looped from the first
# `docker compose up` and `infra/deploy.sh` rolled the deploy back on its health gate. QV-08.
# The stage, its `/healthz` contract and the `egress` network that isolated it are recorded
# in ADR 0031 and docs/deploy/HANDOFF.md §14 so they can be restored rather than re-derived.
# Two images ship: `runner` and `migrator`.
#
# NO SECRETS ARE ACCEPTED OR BAKED IN. There is no ARG or ENV here that carries a
# credential, and no `--mount=type=secret` is required, because the build does not talk to
# the database or to any authenticated service. Every secret is supplied at *runtime* via
# env_file. If a future build step ever needs a token, use BuildKit secret mounts
# (`RUN --mount=type=secret,id=...`) and never an ARG — ARG values are visible in
# `docker history`.

# bookworm-slim rather than alpine: the app links against native modules (pg, esbuild via
# tsx, sharp if it is ever added) and glibc avoids a whole class of musl-only bugs. It is
# ~40 MB larger and worth it for something that must run unattended for months.
#
# NOTE ON PINNING: this is pinned to the major line only. Pin a digest before you consider
# the deployment stable — see docs/deploy/HANDOFF.md for the exact command to resolve one.

# corepack ships with Node 22. `corepack enable` makes the `pnpm` shim available; the shim
# then reads the "packageManager" field in package.json and materialises exactly that
# version (pnpm@11.1.3), so the container and CI cannot drift from the lockfile's producer.
#
# `corepack prepare --activate` is not optional here, and the first real deploy is what
# proved it. The shim downloads pnpm ON FIRST USE, at RUN TIME. The migrate container runs
# on the `backend` network, which is `internal: true` and has no route to the internet — by
# design, since the database must not be reachable from outside. So `pnpm db:migrate` died
# with `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org` and took the deploy with it.
#
# Preparing the version at BUILD time, when the network is available, bakes the tarball into
# the image. Nothing is fetched at run time, which is also the correct property for a
# migration step: it must not depend on npm being reachable, or up, at the moment you are
# trying to fix production.
#
# COREPACK_HOME is set explicitly, and that is the half that took a second deploy to find.
# `corepack prepare` runs as root and would cache into /root/.cache/node/corepack; both the
# migrator and runner stages then `USER node`, whose home is /home/node, so the cache is
# unreadable and corepack silently falls back to downloading — exactly the failure the
# prepare was added to prevent. A shared path plus a+rX makes the cache readable by whoever
# the stage ends up running as.

# The second check matters just as much: Next.js places server.js at the *workspace root
# relative path* inside .next/standalone. In a monorepo (or any repo Next.js decides is a
# monorepo because of a pnpm-workspace.yaml above the app) the entrypoint lands at
# .next/standalone/<path/to/app>/server.js instead of .next/standalone/server.js.
# This repo has the app and pnpm-workspace.yaml at the same directory, so the flat layout
# is expected — but assert it rather than assume it, because the failure mode if this ever
# changes is a container that builds fine and will not boot.

# from the same source, run with `docker compose run --rm migrate`, and thrown away.
#
# The whole source tree is copied because the Drizzle SQL migration folder location is
# owned by the backend engineer (db/migrations, drizzle/, or whatever drizzle.config.ts
# points at) and hard-coding a guess here would break the day it moves. This image is
# ephemeral and never exposed, so the extra size costs nothing at runtime.
