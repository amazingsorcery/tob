 * The application shell.
 *
 * FONTS — `docs/brand/type.md` §3, `docs/brand/HANDOFF.md` §4
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Three files: Sans 400, Sans 600, Mono 400. Latin only. No italics, no Sans 500/700, no
 * Mono 600. Adding a weight needs a reason written into `type.md` first, because this
 * ships to a 2–4 GB VPS and to a reader on a train.
 *
 * `next/font/google` downloads the files at build time and self-hosts them from our own
 * origin, so **no reader's browser ever makes a request to Google**. That is a requirement
 * from product-brief §3.2, not an optimisation: a third-party font request would leak every
 * reader's IP and referrer to a third party, and Persona C would treat that as
 * disqualifying. Do not replace this with a `<link>` to `fonts.googleapis.com`.
 *
 * THE `-loaded` SUFFIX IS LOAD-BEARING. `app/tokens.css` §5 declares `--font-sans` and
 * `--font-mono` as the full fallback stacks, each beginning with `var(--font-*-loaded)`.
 * Passing `variable: "--font-sans"` here would make that token reference itself, which is
 * invalid at computed-value time and would silently drop the whole stack. `docs/brand/
 * HANDOFF.md` §4 shows the un-suffixed form; `tokens.css` is the shipped contract and wins.
 *
 * The variable classes go on `<html>`, not `<body>`. `--font-sans` is declared on `:root`
 * and a `var()` inside a custom property is resolved on the element that declares it — so
 * `--font-sans-loaded` must exist at `:root` too, or `--font-sans` resolves to nothing and
 * every element falls back to the browser's default face.

          Theme, applied before first paint. Inline and synchronous on purpose: a stored
          choice and `prefers-color-scheme` are only readable on the client, and anything
          React renders runs after the browser has already painted. ADR 0016 §4–§5.

          React writes the children of a `<script>` element as raw text — it escapes only a
          literal closing-script sequence — so this needs no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and
          therefore needs no lint exception either. ADR 0016 §5 grants one for exactly this
          script; it turned out not to be necessary. See docs/frontend/HANDOFF-shell.md §8.

          nothing user-controlled interpolated into it, and nothing ever may be.

          THE SESSION PROVIDER IS CONDITIONAL, and this is the one place the deployment mode
          reaches the whole tree.

          In public-only mode (ADR 0032) no provider is configured, so no session can exist.
          The two leaves that read one — the nav's session links and the account control —
          are not rendered at all in that mode, so mounting the provider would buy nothing
          and cost one `/api/auth/session` request per page view for an answer that is
          always "nobody". `components/layout/site-nav.tsx` and `account-menu.tsx` are split
          so that `useSession` is never called rather than merely ignored, which is what
          makes dropping it safe: `useSession` throws outside a provider, and their tests
          render them without one.
