#   ./infra/backup.sh                      normal nightly run
#   ./infra/backup.sh --quiet              log to stderr, print only the dump path to stdout

#
# FORMAT — why custom format piped through gzip rather than either alone:
#   pg_dump -Fc produces a compressed archive, so gzipping it again would normally be
#   pointless. We pass -Z 0 to turn pg_dump's internal compression OFF and compress once
#   with gzip -9 instead. Two concrete reasons:
#     1. `gzip -t` gives a cheap, standard, whole-file CRC check. A custom-format archive
#        has no equivalent one-liner.
#     2. gzip -9 on the uncompressed stream beats pg_dump's default level, and the CPU
#        cost is paid at 03:00 on an otherwise idle box.
#   The archive inside is still custom format, so pg_restore keeps selective restore,
#   parallel restore and --list.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT BACK UP: uploaded files (there are none in v1), the Caddy certificate
# volume (regenerable from Let's Encrypt), and .env (it holds secrets and must be backed up
# separately, by hand, into your password manager — not into a nightly tarball that then
# gets copied to a cloud bucket).
